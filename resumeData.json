        "bio2": "Throughout my four years at Willamette University I played forward for the men’s soccer team, became NWC Conference Champions in 2017 and continued onto the NCAA tournament. With that in the rear-view, I am constantly sought fonewr ways to push myself. I swapped 5 AM team workouts for untouched snow on dawn patrol and the opportunity to just sit and appreciate a pretty sunrise here and there.",
        "bio3": "Just as I condition my body, I would be incomplete if i neglected my mind. What I love most about coding is the constant challenge. Each problem is a puzzle, complex yes, but still a puzzle nonetheless. Sometimes all it takes is seeing it from a different angle. Caffeine helps too. Although it may get frustrating at times, the more rigorous the exercise the more fulfillment gained.",
